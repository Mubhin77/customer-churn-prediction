# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end AI/ML solution that predicts customer churn for a subscription-based business.  
It enables businesses to proactively detect customers likely to churn so they can implement targeted retention strategies, reducing revenue loss.

## Dataset
We use the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset** (Kaggle):  
[Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

**Key Features:**
- Customer demographics
- Account information
- Service usage statistics
- Churn label (Yes/No)
