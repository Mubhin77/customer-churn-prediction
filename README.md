## 📌 Overview  
This project predicts **customer churn** for a subscription-based telecom service provider. The objective is to identify customers likely to leave and enable proactive retention strategies.  

The workflow covers **business framing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, MLOps pipeline design, and leadership roadmap**, showcasing both technical and business perspectives.  

---

## 🎯 Business Problem  
- **Churn Definition:** A customer is considered churned if they discontinue their subscription.  
- **Business Impact:** Customer acquisition costs are high; retaining customers is more cost-effective. Reducing churn improves revenue and customer lifetime value.  
- **Success Metrics:**  
  - Reduce churn rate (from 26.5% → lower).  
  - Improve retention ROI.  
  - Increase average customer tenure.

## 📂 Dataset Information  
- **Rows:** 7,043  
- **Columns:** 21  
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes/No)  

### Key Features:  
- **Demographics:** `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`  
- **Services:** `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`, `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `StreamingTV`, etc.  
- **Contracts & Payments:** `Contract`, `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod`  
- **Financial:** `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`  
- **Target:** `Churn`  

### Churn Distribution:  
- **No Churn:** 5,174 customers  
- **Churn:** 1,869 customers (~26.5%)  
- ⚠️ **Imbalanced dataset** – special care needed (SMOTE, class weights).  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data quality check: No missing values, but `TotalCharges` requires conversion to numeric.  
- Churn analysis by:  
  - **Contract type** → higher churn for month-to-month customers.  
  - **Tenure** → short-tenure customers churn more.  
  - **Payment method** → electronic check users churn more.  
- Visualizations: Histograms, boxplots, bar charts for churn drivers.  

---

## 🤖 Model Development  
- **Baseline:** Logistic Regression (simple interpretability).  
- **Advanced Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost.  
- **Handling Imbalance:**  
  - Class weights in models.  
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision & Recall  
  - F1-score  
  - ROC-AUC  

---

## ⚙️ MLOps Pipeline (Design)  
1. **Data Ingestion** → Collect new churn-related data monthly.  
2. **Preprocessing** → Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features.  
3. **Model Training** → Logistic Regression + Random Forest.  
4. **Deployment** → Expose via API / dashboard.  
5. **Monitoring** →  
   - Track accuracy, precision/recall drift.  
   - Retrain every 1–3 months.

## 🛠 Leadership Roadmap (3–6 Months)  
- **Month 1:** Proof of Concept → Build initial churn prediction model.  
- **Month 2–3:** Pilot → Deploy on a small customer segment.  
- **Month 4–6:** Scale → Full integration with CRM system + real-time churn prediction.  
- **Best Practices:** GitHub version control, CI/CD pipeline, reproducibility, monitoring.  
- **Emerging Trends:**  
  - Explainable AI for churn insights.  
  - Real-time churn alerts.  
  - Generative AI for personalized retention offers.
